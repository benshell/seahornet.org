<p>Classes haven't even started, but we've already formed a group, selected a project, and starting working.  Our team is made up of three members: myself (Benjamin Shell), Jacob McGrew, and Derek Hartl.  We're mechanical engineering students at Sacramento State University taking our senior project design classes (ME 190 and 191).  The project we've choosen to design and build is a submersible robot (ROV).  Many details will follow in the weeks and months to come, so check back here often.  We hope you will enjoy the blog.</p>
