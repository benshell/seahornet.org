<p>Our ROV frame assembly is complete and we've bonded the piece together using an ABS adhesive.  It's exciting to be making progress.  It was a really a surprise to all of us how small the frame is.  We've been working with drawings and 3D models all last semester and it just seemed like the frame would be bigger.  This is a good size though.  We put a lot of effort into making our ROV as small as possible.  The frame is 19" long, 12" wide, and just 7" tall (with the fairing the ROV will be about 10" tall).</p>
