<p>We'd like to thank Carrillo Underwater Systems for their generous donation of two C-Lites!  They just arrived today and we haven't had a chance to try them yet, but I think this is the last major component we need.  Now we just need to finish putting things together and seal the cables going in and out of our electronics housings (currently our #1 issue).  </p>
