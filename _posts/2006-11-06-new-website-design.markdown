<p>This website has been up for a couple months now, but I finally finished a new design for it.  The home page will now be a place for news about our project and we&#39;ve posted more detailed project information on other pages.  Once we start the construction phase we&#39;ll have a lot more to write about (and take pictures of).</p>
