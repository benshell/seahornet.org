<p>UPS really needs to do something about <a href="http://www.unitedpackagesmashers.com/?page=packages.php" target="_blank">the way they handle packages</a>!  Here's another damaged box I just received this morning. The bottom of the box was completely open!  Fortunately (surprisingly) it still contained the O-rings and O-ring lubricant that we ordered from McMaster-Carr.  Take a look at the enlarged version of this picture.  I love the box brand name and slogan: <strong>Reliable Container Corp / Our name says it all</strong>. </p>
