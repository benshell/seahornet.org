<p>100 feet of tether from <a href="http://www.protacraft.com/" target="_blank">ProtaCraft</a> just showed up this morning!  It'll probably be a couple weeks until we're able to do our first pool test, but prior to that I'm sure Jacob is going to want to put the tether in the pool to test its neutral buoyancy.  We can also hook up our power supply and test for voltage drop.  Voltage drop calculators haven't been too helpful (they all produce different results) so we're hoping the voltage drop isn't too bad.  Our power supply (a Mean Well SP-750) is adjustable from about 21 volts to 31 volts, and we only need about 20 volts, so hopefully this is enough range to compensate for the resistance of the 14 gauge power cables in the tether.</p>
