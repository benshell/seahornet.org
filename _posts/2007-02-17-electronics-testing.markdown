<p>As soon as we finished gluing the frame together (and waiting for the glue to set) we mounted all four thrusters.  Our power supply also arrived this week, so I've started testing the electronics and software.  I've developed a Visual Basic program that interfaces with a joystick to drive the thrusters.  The ROV is a big priority for us this week because we're going to have a table at the <a href="http://www.sacbots.org" target="_blank">Engineering Expo</a> at Sac State this Sunday (tomorrow).  We're planning to have an interactive demo where people can grab the joystick and run the thrusters.  We're also planning to continuously run our ME 190 presentation on Jacob's laptop. </p>
