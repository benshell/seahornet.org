<p>We did our first pool test today!  It worked!  We're not done -- there are still many things to do over the next couple weeks -- but our initial test was a success.  Most importantly, there were no leaks. We need to make a few tweaks to the control system, but it was still really fun to pilot our ROV.  It's a good thing I had to get to class and Jacob had other commitments or else we could have spent the entire day running the ROV around the pool.</p>
<p>Download a 2 minute video if you'd like to see how it worked.  The ROV camera wasn't hooked up yet (it will be for the next test, probably on Monday) so this is video taken from the my handheld camera.</p>
